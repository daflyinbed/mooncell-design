## CSS Reset
### Global reset
A fork of modern-normalize@v3.0.0 is reexported as `reset.css`.
```css
import "@mooncell/design/reset.css"
```
### Scoping on children
However, you might be progressively migrating a website to Mooncell Design, using a global reset might not be an option. It's possible to apply the baseline only to the children by using the Scoped Reset. Everything is scoped under `.m-reset`
```css
import "@mooncell/design/scoped-reset.css"
```
